- Youâ€™ve set up Apple or Google Merchant ID's and certificates in your Apple or Google Developer account.

## Payment Data Cryptography

Google Pay encrypts payment information before it leaves the userâ€™s device using industry-standard public key cryptography. When your app receives the payment response, it contains:

- **Encrypted Payment Data** â€” Sensitive card/payment details
- **Signature** â€” For verifying data integrity
- **Intermediate Signing Key** â€” Used to validate the signature

### How Google Pay Encryption Works
1. **Device Encryption** â€” Google Pay encrypts the payment data using your payment processorâ€™s public key.
2. **Data Transport** â€” The encrypted blob is returned to your app through the Google Pay API.
3. **Signature Verification** â€” Your server verifies the signature using the intermediate signing key provided in the response.
4. **Decryption** â€” Your server decrypts the payment data using your private key.
5. **Processing** â€” The decrypted details are sent to your payment processor for authorization.

### Important
- **Never** decrypt payment data in the client app.
- Always verify the signature before decryption.
- Keep private keys secure and only on your backend server.
